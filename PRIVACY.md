# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains what information [https://www.textile.io/](https://www.textile.io) and its related entities (“Textile”, "We Are Set, Inc", and "Textile.photos") collect about its users, what we do with that information and how we handle the content you place in our products and services. Learn more about Web Analytics & Privacy.

## Scope of Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the information that we obtain through your use of textile.photos services via a Device or when you otherwise interact with Textile and We Are Set, Inc.

Textile services include our:

* Textile Websites (textile.io and subdomains \*.textile.io),
* Textile Photos Websites (textile.photos and subdomains \*.textile.photos),

but does not include:

* Products or services for which a separate privacy policy is provided.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Textile collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Textile’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Textile’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Textile may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Textile also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Textile does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. All IP address collected are anonymized to two bytes of accuracy (e.g. 192.168.xxx.xxx) and are fully deleted after 180 days. Aggregate reports are kept longer.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Textile’s websites choose to interact with the website in ways that require Textile to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Textile gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email address. We ask visitors who join our waitlist or mailing list to provide an email address. In each case, Textile collects such information only as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Textile.io or Textile.photos. Textile does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Textile will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.

If you are a registered user of a Textile newsletter and have supplied your email address, Textile may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Textile and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.

Textile takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Aggregated Statistics

Textile may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Textile may reveal how many visitors a particular blogpost got, or say which blog posts are most popular.

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Textile.io and Textile.photos use cookies to help Textile identify and track visitors, their usage of the website, and their website access preferences. Textile visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Textile’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Textile’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Textile may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Textile’s sole discretion. Textile encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
